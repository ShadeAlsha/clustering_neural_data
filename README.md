# 18.065 Final Project

In this project me and my teammate processed the activity data of neurons and applied dimensionality reduction methods to reduce it using Numpy and Scikit-learn libraries in Python. Then we applied techniques from machine learning such as PCA and k-means to understand the activity of the neurons. Finally, we created six classes of neurons that had different activity profiles.
